### **Hackers Abuse Milanote’s Legitimate Service for Phishing – Dutch Variant Detected**  
```Date: 30-JAN-2025```

[Threat Intelligence Lab](https://threatintelligencelab.com) and [SecureMe2](https://secureme2.eu) have observed **a Dutch phishing campaign exploiting Milanote’s legitimate service**, following earlier reports from Avanan. While **Milanote itself is not a malicious platform**, cybercriminals are **abusing its trusted infrastructure** to deceive victims.  

### **How the Attack Works**  
Attackers **scrape LinkedIn** for target information and then send fake Milanote invitations from **support at milanote.com**. Because the email originates from **a legitimate Milanote domain**, it easily **bypasses security filters**.  

The Milanote page itself is **not harmful**, but **attackers embed a hidden phishing link** inside. When victims click, they are redirected to **a fake login page**, where their credentials are unknowingly stolen.  

### **Why This Attack Works**  
- The email **appears trustworthy** because it’s sent from Milanote’s official service.  
- **No direct phishing links** in the email body make detection harder.  
- Milanote is **widely used by businesses**, increasing trust in the invitation.  

Threat actors are increasingly **abusing legitimate collaboration tools** to evade security checks. Milanote is not the problem—but **its trust and reputation are being weaponized**.
